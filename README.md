# Faith Habit Tracker (React + Firebase)

This is a minimal Vite + React app that connects to Firebase Auth and Firestore
to track weekly spiritual habits (devotional, pages, reps) and reduce negatives
(anger, social media, porn).

## Quick start (local)
- npm i
- npm run dev

## Deploy
- Push this folder to a GitHub repo.
- Import the repo in Vercel or Netlify, build command `npm run build`, output `dist/`.
